What I have learned from this course is an introduction to Git and GitHub, which has helped me understand
how to manage and collaborate on code more effectively. Iâ€™ve learned how to create pull requests, make
commits to GitHub, and fork repositories to work on projects independently. The course also introduced
me to the foundations of Linux, which has improved my confidence in using the command line. Overall,
gaining these version control skills has made me feel more prepared to contribute to real-world software
projects and collaborate with others in a professional workflow.
