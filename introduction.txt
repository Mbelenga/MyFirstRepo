I am Terrence Owiti, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong foundation in Python.
I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including C, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
My expertise in Python has allowed me to work on and complete various software projects that demonstrate my problem-solving skills and creativity.

In addition to my current skill set, I am continually seeking to grow as a developer and expand my knowledge base. I am planning to start learning Java very soon to broaden my technical capabilities.
My goal is to keep building innovative and impactful projects while staying up to date with the latest technologies in the software development world.
